Hey, happy you've agreed to have a chat! I'll describe the process of the
interview here and answer common questions.

## Overview

Every episode of Code explores one topic in depth. A couple of examples:
[Type Systems](https://soundcloud.com/podcastcode/5-type-systems) or [How
to Design
Software](https://soundcloud.com/podcastcode/4-how-to-design-software-ogg).

Our process:

- We do several interviews
- Pick interesting fragments of those interviews
- Stitch them together, add narration, add music
- Have one or two rounds of reviews from listeners and guests
- Release the episode

## FAQ

### What will we use for the call?

- Hangouts: [link](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/andreysalomatin.me/code-podcast-interview)
- or Skype: filipovskii\_off

### How long will it take?

Around 1 hour.

### Do I need to read something before?

There're no *specific* materials to check or prepare. Feel free to review
favorite sources on the topic.

### What's required for the recording from my side?

- Headphones, so your microphone doesn't capture the voice of the
  interviewer
- If we'll end up using Skype, "Automatically adjust microphone settings"
  in `Preferences -> Audio/Video` should be **unchecked**
- A quiet room

### What are the good-to-haves?

- An external microphone
- An ability to record **your voice** while we talk e.g. QuickTime on Mac
  can do that.  Iâ€™ll record myself and you over Skype. Skype introduces
  delay and quality might be poor. If you record yourself, the audio
  quality of your track will be much better.

### Will I get the draft of the episode before it's released?

Yes.

Looking forward to talking with you!
