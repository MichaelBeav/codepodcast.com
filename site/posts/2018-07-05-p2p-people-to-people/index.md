Slack servers are down and work stops. Facebook sells users' personal data
to third-parties with no negative consequences to the company. Turkey
successfully blocks citizens' access to Wikipedia. Those are all results
of peoples' decisions of course, but there's also something else at play.
Our mainstream technology stack make execution on all of those decisions
ridiculously easy.

The Internet didn't quite deliver on its original promise and today we're
talking with people who are fixing it.
