I'm launching a [patreon campaign][patreon], now there's a way to
support Code Podcast!

<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no"

I'm back at work on the show and would like to release an episode at least
every two months. To do that I need your help. If you are getting value
from the podcast, please consider contributing to the campaign.

Your support will help make episodes regularly. Currently I have to
balance the podcast with other commitments that pay the rent. With your
contributions I hope to gradually spend more and more time on what I love
doing â€“ this podcast!

[[Go to the campaign]][patreon]

To other news, we have an episode lined up for the next week! The episode
is about Ethereum and formal verification. We worked on it for the past
couple of months and are very proud of how it turned out.

Exciting times ahead! Thanks you for your support!
